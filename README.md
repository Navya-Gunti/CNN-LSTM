The aim of this assignment is to find the find difference in prediction or report when we train the model using different approaches.
Using CNN:
Mixed CNN and LSTM:
Created a convolutional neural network model with two 1D convolutional layers. Use
sigmoid activation and apply a dropout of 0.3 after creating the convolution layers. In the end, created a softmax layer. Predicted whether the names in test data are male or female. Evaluated
the predictions .
 Using LSTM: Created a simple sequential model with an LSTM layer of 32 units. Use sigmoid activation. Predicted whether the names in test data are male or female. Evaluated your predictions.
 Mixed LSTM and CNN for prediction. Combined LSTM and CNN to
 make predictions. Tried different activation functions and dropout rates and evaluated.
